This is a simple module that can parse an informal specification of time and return a python datetime object. Time can be specified as:

     11:15am
     20:45
     tomorrow 9am
     Thursday 11:15
     mon 6 am

     +1h
     +2d
     +1h30m     
     +7d 12h 30m

The relative times (starting with a '+') will be converted to an absolute time offset from now.

Usage:
        from parsewhen import parse_when
        parse_when('Saturday 11:15 am')

        (returns a datetime.datetime object)        
        
*Note: don't use this module unless you've already looked at dateutil.parser 
and found it to be inappropriate for your use. *
